* Calculation of the van der waals surface                                       
* In this example we will use the coordinates given in set2.xyzr                 

 The Van der Waals Surface is calculated
 ---------------------------------------
 NDIV                                  =   3

 The coordinates will be read from file
 SET2.XYZR                                                                       

 The file with the sphere information is
 TEST2.SPH                                                                       

 The file with the Vectors is
 TEST2.VEC                                                                       
 DVEC =   1.00000  then:
 The module of the vectors is =   1.00000
 The vectors are pointing outward

 The file to be used by Helios is
 TEST2.DIS                                                                       


 Title found in coordinate file
 -------------------------------
* SET2.XYZR                                                                     
* This is a coordinate file to be used by GEPOL93                               
* In this example we will not center spheres on the hydrogen atoms (R=0.00)     
* This is an example to illustrate the use of ghost spheres (negative radii)    
* Only the surface of LEU 4 will be calculated                                  

 About initial set of coordinates
 --------------------------------
 Number of coord. without sphere =      10
 Number of ghost spheres         =      29
 Number of spheres               =       8
 Number of TOTAL coord.          =      47
