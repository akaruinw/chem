C*** OLD VERSIONS
C
C     - GEPOL87 by J.L. Pascual-Ahuir, E. Silla, J. Tomasi and R. Bonacorsi
C     - GEPOL92 by J.L. Pascual-Ahuir, E. Silla and I. Tunon.
C 
C*** Modifications with respect to GEPOL92
C     The modifications affect mainly the computation of the Solvent-
C     Excluding Surface (ESURF). There are important changes in the 
C     algorithm of the computation of the ESURF. The set of parameters
C     used for that computation is different from the old versions.
C     The computation of the surfaces of large systems as proteins,
C     with the old versions, takes a lot of time. With GEPOL93 this 
C     problem has been solved. For a clear description of the new
C     algorithm see reference D.

C*** Aim
C
C       This program computes the surface for a molecule as a distribution
C       of points and calculates its area and the volume enclosed. Each
C       point represents a piece of the surface named a tesserae. 
C
C       Three kinds of envelope surfaces can be computed:
C
C         - THE VAN DER WAALS MOLECULAR SURFACE. This is the envelope
C       surface of a set of intersecting spheres with given atomic radii 
C       centered on the nuclei of selected atoms of the molecule.
C
C         - THE ACCESSIBLE MOLECULAR SURFACE. This was defined by
C       B.Lee and F.M.Richards (J.MOL.BIOL.55(1971)379-400). It is the
C       surface defined by the center of the solvent, considered as a 
C       rigid sphere (probe sphere), when it rolls around the van der 
C       Waals surface. 
C
C         - THE SOLVENT-EXCLUDING SURFACE. This is the surface envelope 
C       of the volume excluded to the solvent, considered as a rigid 
C       sphere (probe sphere), when it rolls around the van der Waals 
C       surface. It was defined initially by F. M. Richards and named 
C       as the MOLECULAR SURFACE (Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng.,6 (1977)
C       151-176) 
C       GEPOL constructs the SOLVENT-EXCLUDING SURFACE creating a 
C       set of new spheres located among the original spheres defined in 
C       the input geometry.

C*** Computacional especifications
C
C       This program is written in FORTRAN 77 and has been run on 
C        VAX (VMS)
C        SILICON GRAPHICS (UNIX)
C        IBM RISC (AIX)

C*** Input
C       
C       GENERAL INPUT (FOR005)
C       ----------------------
C       This file will have the commands and parameters that control 
C       the program.
C       Every record is a command and it is divided in two fields:The first
C       five characters of the field form a KEYWORD.The second field is 
C       reserved for parameters.
C       You do not need to put the commands in a given order.
C       There are two types of KEYWORD depending on whether a parameter 
C       is needed in the second field of the record or not. Those that need
C       a parameter have the symbol equal(=) included in the KEYWORD.
C       Every command has a default defined within the program. The default
C       values for the parameters are selected to achieve a good compromise
C       between time and accuracy.
C 
C       Each KEYWORD is explained, as follows:
C 
C  
C  TITL=     This Keyword denotes that the title of the calculation goes 
C            into the second field of the record. You may use up to 20 
C            records as titles, but each record should start with the 
C            keyword TITL=.If you do not use this command the program 
C            will provide a title.
C
C  WSURF     The van der Waals molecular surface is calculated.
C
C  ASURF     The accessible molecular surface is calculated.
C
C  ESURF     The Solvent-Excluding Surface (Molecular Surface) is 
C            calculated.
C
C            ( if you do not put in any of the latter keywords
C              the program will calculate the van der Waals surface)
C
C  NDIV=     In the second field goes an integer that can take values 
C            between 1 and 5. It specifies the division level for the 
C            triangles on the surface. The accuracy of the calculation
C            improves as NDIV rises. The default for this command is 3.
C
C  OFAC=     This parameter will be used only if ESURF is computed.
C            In the second field goes a real number that can take values 
C            between 0.0 and 1.0. This parameter is the Overlapping FACtor.
C            The accuracy improves as the OFAC value increases.The default
C            value is 0.8
C
C  RMIN=     This parameter will be used only if ESURF is computed.
C            In the second field goes a real number that can take values 
C            larger than 0.0. This parameter is the radius of the smallest
C            sphere that can be created.The accuracy improves as the RMIN
C            value decreases.The default value is 0.50.
C
C            (OFAC,RMIN  are the parameters that control the creation
C             of new spheres)
C 
C  RSOL=     This parameter will be used only if ASURF or ESURF is computed.
C            In the second field goes a real number. It is the probe or 
C            solvent radius. The default value is 1.4
C
C  COOF=     In the second field goes the name of the file with the 
C            coordinates and radii.
C
C  SPHF=     The area of every sphere will be printed in the file
C            indicated in the second field. As default, the area of every
C            sphere will not be printed. For more information see later.
C            
C  VECF=     The coordinates of the points, the components of the vectors 
C            perpendicular to the surface and the areas of every tesserae, 
C            will be printed in the file indicated in the second field. 
C            As default the information will not be printed.The file
C            is written in binary format.
C  
C  DVEC=     Only if you have selected VECF=. The number in the second 
C            field gives the direction of the vectors and their module. 
C            If the number is positive they will go outward and if it 
C            is negative inward. The module of the vectors will be equal 
C            to the absolutevalue of the number. As default the value
C            is +1.
C
C  DISF=     This option prints, in the file indicated in the second field,
C            information needed for a program, developed in our laboratory,
C            named HELIOS, that displays the surfaces. As default the 
C            information is not printed. The file is written in binary 
C            format.
C
C  REDUC     Only if  SPHF= has been selected. The use of this command
C            will REDUCe the printing, giving only information about the
C            initial spheres. This option only has sense when the ESURF 
C            is computed.
C
C  ASSG1     Only if ESURF has been selected. This command assigns 
C            the tesserae of the new spheres to the initial ones.
C            Thus the value of the area of each initial sphere will be 
C            the sum of the area of the tesserae of itself plus the area
C            of the tesserae, from the new spheres, assigned to it. 
C            A tesserae is assigned to the sphere whose surface is closest
C            to the tesserae.
C            As DEFAULT no assignation is made.
C
C  LPRIN     This command produce a longer printing in the general output.
C            As default a shorter printing is made
C
C
C       COORDINATES FILE   
C       ----------------
C
C       The name of this file has been given in the general input after
C       the keyword COOF=. The format of the file is given next:
C
C     -- TITLE
C        You can put in as many records of titles as you want, but each 
C        record should start with the symbol *.
C    
C     -- NATOM (I8)
C        Number of atoms
C     
C     -- One record per atom (4F10.5,A33)
C        The Variables in each record are:
C      
C           XE        Coordinate X of the atom.
C           YE        Coordinate Y of the atom.
C           ZE        Coordinate Z of the atom.
C           RE        Radius of the sphere centered on the atom.
C           LABEL     Atom number, atom name, residue number... This 
C                     variable is not used in GEPOL93, it is only read to
C                     be written in the file SPHF= to identify each atom.
C         
C         OBSERVATIONS!!.
C         - With GEPOL93 we provide a program named PGEPOL that prepares
C           this file from others formats (PDB,GROMOS,CHARMM...)
C         - If you give a value to RE of 0.00000 this atom will not 
C           participate at all in the calculation.
C         - If you give a negative value to RE this atom will have a
C           GHOST sphere. Sometimes we are interested only in computing
C           the surface of part of a molecule, but taking into account 
C           the presence of the rest of the molecule. Thus, those atoms
C           that belong to the part of the molecule, which interests us,
C           will have positive RE and the rest of the atoms will have 
C           their proper radii but negative. 
C         - We are developing a set of programs to analyze the output of
C           GEPOL that makes use of the variable LABEL with a specific 
C           format and information. If you are interested in using these
C           programs the format and information of LABEL should be the
C           following:
C            (I8,1x,A4,I7,1x,A4,I3,1x,A4)
C            IAT  Atom number(order)
C            ATN  Atom name
C            IRE  Residue number(order)
C            REN  Residue name
C            ISE  Molecule number
C            SEN  Molecule name
C                     
C

C           AE        Surface Area of this atom or sphere
C    
C     OBSERVATIONS!!
C       - If you have used REDUC you will get only information about the 
C         original spheres.
C
C  -  Information about the tesserae forming the surface.
C    ---------------------------------------------------
C    The name of this file is given after the keyword VECF=. It contains
C    the coordinates of the center of each tesserae, the vectors 
C    perpendicular to the surface at this point, the area of each tesserae.
C    It is written in binary format. The records have the following
C    information:
C      Record 1.     LT      (Integer*4) is the number of title record
C      Next LT rec.  TITLE   (charac.*80) title
C      Rec. LT+2     NP      (Integer*4) Number of tesserae or points.
C      Next NP rec.          (3integer*4,7real*4) each record has the 
C                            following variables:
C
C                    ITO  each sphere can have up to 60 tesserae, ITO gives
C                         the order number of this tesserae among the 60.
C                    ISO  gives the sphere number where the point lies.
C                    ISA  gives the sphere number assigned to this point
C                    XP   coordinate x of the point(center of the tesserae)
C                    YP   coordinate y of the point
C                    ZP   coordinate z of the point
C                    AP   area of the tesserae
C                    XVEC component X of the vector
C                    YVEC component Y of the vector
C                    ZVEC component Z of the vector
C
C*** UNITS
C    The units of the area and volume will depend on the units of your
C    coordinates. Remember that XE,YE,ZE,RE,RSOL and RMIN should have 
C    the same units. Thus if you use Angstroms the area will appear 
C    in Angstroms**2 and the volume in Angstrom**3
C
C*** Other information
C    This information may be useful if you want to add something to the
C    program. 
C    MC = Maximum number of Centers (atoms, spheres)
C    MV = Maximum number of Vectors (points/tesserae)
C    IUSE(I) indicates the type of the center I
