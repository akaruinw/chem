* Calculation of the Solvent-Excluding Surface.                                  
* In this example we will use the coordinates given in set2.xyzr                 
* using ASSG1 and REDUC                                                          

 The Solvent-Excluding Surface is calculated
 -------------------------------------------
 NDIV                                 =   3
 Radius of the solvent         (RSOL) =   1.40000
 Minimum Radius for new sphere (RMIN) =   0.50000
 Overlapping factor            (OFAC) =   0.80000

 The coordinates will be read from file
 SET2.XYZR                                                                       

 The new spheres will be assigned to the initials using ASSG1
 The file with the sphere information is
 TEST8.SPH                                                                       

 The file with the Vectors is
 TEST8.VEC                                                                       
 DVEC =   1.00000  then:
 The module of the vectors is =   1.00000
 The vectors are pointing outward


 Title found in coordinate file
 -------------------------------
* SET2.XYZR                                                                     
* This is a coordinate file to be used by GEPOL93                               
* In this example we will not center spheres on the hydrogen atoms (R=0.00)     
* This is an example to illustrate the use of ghost spheres (negative radii)    
* Only the surface of LEU 4 will be calculated                                  

 About initial set of coordinates
 --------------------------------
 Number of coord. without sphere =      10
 Number of ghost spheres         =      29
 Number of spheres               =       8
 Number of TOTAL coord.          =      47

 About final set of coordinates
 ------------------------------
 Number of INITIAL coordinates               47
 Number of NEW     coordinates              131
 Number of TOTAL   coordinates              178
